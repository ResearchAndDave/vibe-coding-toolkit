> — Chapter 16, Vibe Coding

These prompts help you think like a PM: focusing on "what" and "why" before "how."

## Validation: Are We Building the Right Thing?

### Problem Validation
```
I'm considering building [feature/product].

Help me validate the problem:
1. Who has this problem?
2. How painful is it (1-10)?
3. How do they solve it today?
4. What would they pay/sacrifice for a solution?
5. Is this a vitamin (nice-to-have) or painkiller (must-have)?

Challenge my assumptions.
```

### Market Opportunity
```
Assess the market opportunity for [feature/product]:

1. Who is the target market?
2. How big is it (users, revenue potential)?
3. Is it growing, stable, or shrinking?
4. What competitors exist?
5. What's our potential differentiation?
6. Is this a niche or mainstream opportunity?
```

## Customer Understanding

### Feedback Analysis
```
Analyze this customer feedback:

[Paste feedback, support tickets, reviews, etc.]

Identify:
1. Top 5 recurring pain points
2. Most requested features
3. Patterns in complaints
4. Unexpected use cases
5. Sentiment trends
6. Urgent vs. important issues

Prioritize by frequency and impact.
```

### Persona Development
```
Based on what you know about [product/domain]:

Create a user persona that includes:
1. Demographics and background
2. Goals and motivations
3. Pain points and frustrations
4. Current solutions and workarounds
5. Decision-making factors
6. A day in their life

Make them feel real and specific.
```

### Customer Journey Map
```
Map the customer journey for [task/workflow]:

Stages:
1. Awareness (how they discover the need)
2. Consideration (how they evaluate options)
3. Decision (how they choose)
4. Onboarding (first experience)
5. Regular use (ongoing experience)
6. Expansion/renewal (deepening engagement)

For each stage:
- What are they doing?
- What are they thinking/feeling?
- What are the pain points?
- What are the opportunities?
```

## Competitive Analysis

### Competitor Scout
```
Analyze [competitor(s)] for me:

For each competitor:
1. What's their value proposition?
2. Who are their target customers?
3. What are their strengths?
4. What are their weaknesses?
5. How are they priced?
6. What do customers say about them?

What opportunities do they leave open?
```

### Feature Comparison
```
Compare our approach to [feature] with competitors:

| Aspect | Us | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|--------|----|--------------||--------------|

Consider:
1. Functionality
2. User experience
3. Performance
4. Price/value
5. Integration

Where can we win?
```

---

## Feature Definition

### User Story Generation
```
Turn this idea into well-defined user stories:

Idea: [description]

For each story, include:
- As a [user type]
- I want [capability]
- So that [benefit]

Plus:
- Acceptance criteria
- Edge cases
- Dependencies
- Open questions
```

### Requirements Refinement
```
I have a vague request: [request]

Help me turn it into clear requirements:
1. What exactly should it do?
2. What should it NOT do?
3. Who will use it?
4. How will they access it?
5. What's the success criteria?
6. What are the constraints?
7. What assumptions are we making?

Challenge anything that's unclear.
```

### MVP Definition
```
For [feature/product], help me define the MVP:

Full vision: [description]

What's the minimum we need to:
1. Test the core hypothesis?
2. Deliver value to users?
3. Learn what to build next?

What can we cut? What's essential?
What's the 20% that delivers 80% of value?
```

---

## Prioritization

### RICE Scoring
```
Help me prioritize these features using RICE:

Features:
1. [Feature A]
2. [Feature B]
3. [Feature C]

For each, estimate:
- Reach: How many users affected per time period?
- Impact: How much will it move metrics (1-3)?
- Confidence: How sure are we (0-100%)?
- Effort: How much work (person-months)?

RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Rank and recommend.
```

### Trade-off Analysis
```
Help me make this trade-off decision:

Option A: [description]
Option B: [description]

Analyze:
1. Pros and cons of each
2. Risks of each
3. Reversibility
4. Short-term vs long-term impact
5. Who benefits from each?
6. What do we learn from each?

What would you recommend and why?
```

---

## Experimentation

### A/B Test Design
```
Design an A/B test for [hypothesis]:

1. What exactly are we testing?
2. What's the control vs. variant?
3. What metric will we measure?
4. What's the minimum detectable effect?
5. How large a sample do we need?
6. How long should we run it?
7. What will we do with each outcome?
```

### Assumption Testing
```
We're assuming [assumption] about [product/feature].

Help me design a way to test this:
1. How could we validate without building?
2. What's the fastest way to learn?
3. What evidence would prove us right?
4. What evidence would prove us wrong?
5. What's the cost of being wrong?
```

---

## Strategy

### Roadmap Thinking
```
Help me think through the roadmap for [product]:

Where are we now: [current state]
Where do we want to be: [vision]

What's the sequence of steps?
1. What must come first? (Prerequisites)
2. What builds on what? (Dependencies)
3. What's the highest impact next step?
4. What can be parallelized?
5. What are the key milestones?
```

### Go/No-Go Decision
```
Should we proceed with [initiative]?

Consider:
1. Strategic alignment
2. Resource requirements
3. Opportunity cost
4. Risk assessment
5. Timing
6. Dependencies
7. Success probability

Make a recommendation with confidence level.
```

## Gene's Insight Example

From Chapter 16:

> "AI helped him realize that one of the most important things he could do 
> was improve the speed of the ranking process, not worry about which ranking 
> algorithm to use (i.e., in order to decrease 't' in NK/t)."

**Lesson**: Sometimes AI can help you see that you're solving the wrong problem. Ask:

```
I'm working on [problem/feature].

Challenge my approach:
1. Am I solving the right problem?
2. Is there a bigger lever I'm missing?
3. What would 10x the impact look like?
4. What's the simplest solution?
5. What would a PM push back on?
```
